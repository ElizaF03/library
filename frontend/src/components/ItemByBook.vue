        Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four,
        Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by
        his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harrys eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus
        Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of
        Witchcraft and Wizardry.
